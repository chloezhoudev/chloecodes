I’m Chloe Zhou, a **web developer and indie hacker** passionate about building intuitive web and mobile applications. I specialize in **React, Next.js, and React Native**, crafting seamless user experiences that enhance productivity and engagement.

I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, writing about front-end development, and building tools that solve real problems. Whether it's optimizing UI performance or exploring new frameworks, I’m always looking for ways to create better and more efficient digital experiences.
